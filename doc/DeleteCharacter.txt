Design of the delete character function.

Intent:  Once a user is logged into the server, and before selecting a character, the user shall 
		 be able to delete any character from his account. Since the Auth Server houses information
		 about the user and his characters, the client communicates with the Auth Server to invoke 
		 the deletion of the character specified by the user.

Protocol:
    Communication Direction           Actual Message Sent                       Meaning
	1.  User -> Client                deleteChar charName                       User chooses to delete his character with the name 'charName'
	2.  Client -> User                Are you sure?	This cannot be undone.      Client responds to user confirming the delete of the character.
	3.  User -> Client                yes/no									User confirms/denies.
	Assuming user responded with 'yes':
	4.  Client -> Auth                <deleteChar><charName><username>          Client informs Auth server of the users request to delete the character.
	5.  Auth -> Client                <SUCCESS>									Auth server informs client of success (or failure) .			  

Acceptance Criteria:
    1.  User must be logged in and cannot be playing (have already selected a character).
	2.  A confirmation message is sent to the user in order to ensure that this is what he wants to do.
	3.  User can respond with 'yes' or 'no'.
	4.  If the user does not own the character, he is notified and the character is not deleted.
	5.  If the user responds with 'yes' (and he owns the character), the character, as well as all the character's stats
		are deleted from the database.
	6.  If the user responds with 'no', the character is not deleted and the user can go back to selecting
		a character to play.
