Design of the login function.

Intent:  Logout a user from playing.  This really is the inverse of the play+login command.  
         Upon logout, the user will expect the following to happen:
             1.  The user is saved to the database.
             2.  The user is logged out of the Core server.
             3.  The user is logged out of the ChatServer.
         
Protocol:
    Communication Direction           Actual Message Sent             Meaning
    1.  onSAVE is executed
	2.  Client -> Core                <logout>                        Client logs out of Core server.
	3.  Client -> ChatServer          <logout><Duckie>                Client logs out of ChatServer.
	
Possible Responses:                    Meaning:
1.  <success>                          Username not found
2.  <failure>                          Something really weird happened, i.e. server crash, etc.

Acceptance Criteria:
     1.  The user is saved to the database.
     2.  The user is logged out of the Core server.
     3.  The user is logged out of the ChatServer.
     4.  The user can login again once they are logged out.
