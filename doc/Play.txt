Design of the play function.

Intent:  Login a character to the world.  Basically the play function allows you to do two things.
         First off the client obtains your stats from the Authentication server.  This requires you
         to be logged in, see the prerequsites section.  Second, when the client gets these stats,
         it creates a request to send to the Core server, and it will initiate your player into the 
         world.
         
PreRequisites:
1.  The user must be logged in to call this function.
2.  The user cannot be playing to call this function.
3.  The player cannot exist in the Servers player map.

Protocol Trnasactions:
    1.  Client -> Auth            <play><Duckie>                                  Give me the stats for Duckie plz!
	2.  Auth -> Client            <Duckie><lvl><hp><energy><xp><$$>               Auth server responds with stats.
	3.  Client -> Core            <play><Character1><lvl><hp><energy><xp><$$>     Client forwards stats to Core for init.
	4.  Core -> Client            <success>                                       Server welcomes the new player
	     
     
Possible Responses:               Meaning:
1.  <notLoggedIn>                 Not logged in to the authentication server.
2.  <failure>                     Something really weird happened, i.e. server crash, etc.
3.  <noCharOwnership>             You tried to play a character that you don't own.

Acceptance Criteria:
    1.  Players cannot login as other people's characters.
    2.  Players cannot login as characters that don't exist in the database.
    3.  Players must be logged in to invoke the command.
    4.  Players cannot be playing when they invoke the command.
    5.  The CoreNewton server cannot have the player already in the player map at the time of user using the play command.
    6.  When a user invokes the play command, you will establish connection with 2 servers:
    	1.  Connection with the ChatServer will be established.
    	2.  Connection with the CoreNewton server will be established.
