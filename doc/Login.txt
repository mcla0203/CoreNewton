Design of the login function.

Intent:  Login a user to the server.  This entails establishing connection to Auth server
         and verifying that the account authenticates properly.  The server authenticates
         based on the username and input.  The user will be 'logged in' when the correct 
         password is typed in.  Specifically, the AccountService has a login method that
         verifies that the account was logged in properly.
         
Protocol:
    Communication Direction           Actual Message Sent                       Meaning
	1.  Client -> Auth                <login><user><pw>                         Client attempts login.
	2.  Auth -> Client                <SUCCESS>                                 Client enters login state.
	
Possible Responses:                    Meaning:
1.  <noUsersFound>                     Username not found
2.  <noCharsCreated>                   No characters are created on the account yet (still logs in)
3.  <passwordIncorrect>                Password typed in by user didn't match the database
4.  <failure>                          Something really weird happened, i.e. server crash, etc.

Acceptance Criteria:
    1.  Player can login to the authentication server.
	2.  Player is informed if they typed an incorrect password or username.
	3.  Player can login to the authentication server after a bad login attempt.
	4.  Player cannot login when logged in.
