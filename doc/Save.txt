Design of the save function.

Intent:  Save a characters stats.  Uses the auth server.  The idea here is to retrieve the latest stats
         from the Core server, and forward that information to the Auth server to save the stats.
         
Protocol:
    Communication Direction           Actual Message Sent                       Meaning
	1.  Client -> Core                <save><CharacterName>                     Client requests stats for character.
	2.  Core -> Client                <Character1><lvl><hp><energy><xp><$$>     Core server response with stats
	3.  Client -> Auth                <Character1><lvl><hp><energy><xp><$$>     Client forwards stats to Auth to process.
	4.  Auth -> Client                <sucess>                                  Auth server responds with success.
	
Acceptance Criteria:
    1.  Current stats on the Core server are saved on the Auth server.
    2.  Player is informed if there was success on the save.
    3.  On the next login, the character should have all the latest stats since the save.
    4.  Other characters stats are NOT affected by another characters' save.
